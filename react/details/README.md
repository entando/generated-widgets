# Details Widget

## Widget API

### Attributes

- **locale** (default: `en`)
- **id**

### Environment variables

There are several environment variables used in the widget that provide initial configuration of the widget. To set that up, create `.env` file in the root folder following constants:

- REACT_APP_DOMAIN - API endpoint for data (e.g., http://localhost:8081/services/jhipster/api)

## i18n

To add a new locale:

- add a new locale file under `src/i18n/locales/[newLocaleName].json`
- add the created locale file to `src/i18n/locales/index.js`
- locale file should contain `translation` as its root object

## Available Scripts

This project is extending the [Airbnb Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) eslint rules, and applying custom rules (see package.json) to improve code quality.

## Folder structure

- ./src
  - ./api `--> api calls, grouped by feature: the structure should mimic the api call itself`

    - ./\_mocks `--> mock data for tests`
    - ./\_types `--> PropTypes for components`
    - ./common `--> folder containing common components`
      - CommonComponent.js
